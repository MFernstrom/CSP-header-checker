# SeurityHeaders
Analyze security headers

<img src="screenshot.png">

# About
Security Headers Check makes a GET request to the specified URL, analyzes the headers, and shows the results to you in an easy-to-understand way.

You also get the http code and raw headers in the bottom field.

## Plans
Check https://github.com/MFernstrom/SeurityHeaders/projects for details, but plans are to add options for POST requests with Form fields and File uploads.

## Test
During development I used `https://www.serpworx.com/check-security-headers/` to test, as they implement a number of headers.
